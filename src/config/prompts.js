    // Classification prompt
    classification: `
    You are an AI assistant specialized in crypto trading. Your task is to classify the following message from a Telegram crypto group.
    Classify the message as ONE of the following categories:
    1. 'crypto_signal' - if it contains explicit trading signals with specific buy/sell recommendations, clear entry/exit points, defined stop loss levels, or detailed trading instructions. Crypto signals focus on actionable trading advice with specific instructions.
    2. 'crypto_news' - if it reports news about cryptocurrencies, market analysis, price action commentary, general support/resistance levels, or crypto market observations without specific trading instructions. Market updates and analysis without explicit trade recommendations fall here.
    3. 'alert' - if it's an urgent message about market warnings, security incidents, regulatory updates, or important events requiring immediate attention
    4. 'noise' - if it's unrelated to the above categories or is just casual conversation
  
    The message is delimited by triple quotes:
    """
    {message}
    """
  
    Only respond with one of the category names: 'crypto_signal', 'crypto_news', 'alert', or 'noise'. Do not include any explanations.
